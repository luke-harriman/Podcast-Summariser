'Are you afraid of death? Let's start with an easy question. There's no warm up. That's it. It's great. No warm up. They're jumping, Jacks. Let's break that down into two questions. I'm a human being, and like any human being, I'm biologically programmed to be terrified of death. Every physical element in our body is designed to keep us away from death. I'm no different from anyone else in that regard. If you throw me from the top of the Empire State Building, I'm going to scream all the way down to the concrete. If you wave a loaded firearm in my face, I'm going to flinch away and horror the same way anyone else would. In that first sense of are you afraid of death? My body is terrified of injury leading to death the same way in any other human being. When death is imminent, there's a terror that... I go to the same adrenaline dumps that you would go through. But on the other hand, you're also asking a much deeper question, which is presumably, are you afraid of non-existence? What comes after your physical death? That's the more interesting question. I should start right by saying from the start, I'm a materialist. I don't believe that we have in a mortal soul. I don't believe there's a life after our physical death. In this sense, from someone who starts from that point of view, you have to understand that everyone has two deaths. We always talk about our death, so there was only one, but we all have two deaths. There was a time before you were born when you were dead. You weren't afraid of that period of non-existence. You don't even think about it. Why would you be afraid of your second period of non-existence? You came from non-existence. You're going to go back into it. You weren't afraid of the first. Why are you somehow afraid of the second? It doesn't really make sense to me as to why people would be afraid of non-existence. You dealt with it fine the first time, deal with it the second time. Your mind didn't exist for the first death. It wouldn't exist after you die, either. But it does exist now enough to comprehend that there's this thing that you know nothing about that's coming, which is non-existence. Actually, you do know about it because you know what it was like before you were born. It was just nothing. Every time you go to sleep at night, you get a sneak preview of death. It's just this kind of nothing happens. You wake up in the morning, you're alive again. It's not about the sleeping. It's about the falling asleep. Every night when you fall asleep, you assume you're going to wake up. Here you know you're not waking up. The knowledge of that. There's a whole step from that to the idea of fearing it. I'm fully aware that there's going to be a time I don't wake up. But are you going to be afraid of it? Is there some mortal terror you have of this? No, you didn't have it before. You don't have it when you sleep. Going from the fact that you know you won't wake up to terror is two different things. That's an extra step. At that point, you're making a choice at that point. What about what some people in this context we may call the third death, which is when everybody forgets the entirety of consciousness in the universe, forgets that you've ever existed, that John Donner, or her ever existed. So it's the one that's going to cause my death. It's like everything goes. Not just, I would say it's like knowledge, the history books forget about who you are, because the history books, this is inevitable. By the way, we're all very, very small players in a very big game. And inevitably, we're all going to go at some point. Yeah, but it doesn't. To your, it's disappointing, of course. But it's not even arrogance to say, I'm disappointing the idea that I will disappear. There's this far greater things than me that will disappear. I mean, it's crushing to think that there's going to come a time where no one will ever hear Beethoven symphonies again, that the mysteries of the pharaohs will be lost and no one will even comprehend that they once existed. Humanity has come up with so many amazing things of its existence. And to think that one day, this is just all happening on a tiny speck in a distant corner of a very small galaxy and among millions of galaxies that this is all for nothing. Okay, I can understand there's a kind of a dread that comes with this. But there's also a sense in which, the moment you're born and the moment you can think about these things, you know this is your inevitable fate. Is it so inevitable? So if we look at, we're in Austin and there's a guy named Elon Musk and he's hoping, in fact, that is the drive behind many of his passions is the human beings becoming multi-planetary species and expanding out, exploring and colonizing the solar system, the galaxy and maybe the rest of the universe. Is that something that fills you with excitement? It's as a project. It's very exciting. I mean, we all grew up with science fiction, the idea of exploration the same way. Human beings in earlier centuries were thrilled that the idea of discovering a new world, you know, America or some other part of the world that they sailed to and come back. But now instead of sailing oceans, you're sailing solar systems and ultimately leave even further. So of course, it's exciting. But as far as relieving us from non-existence, it's just playing a delaying game because ultimately even the universe itself, if the laws of thermodynamics are correct, will ultimately die. Of course, we might not understand most of the physics and how the universe functions. You said laws of thermodynamics, but maybe that's just a tiny little fraction of what the universe actually is. Maybe there's multiple dimensions. Maybe there's multiple universes. Maybe the entirety of this experience. You know, there's guys like Donald Hoffman. I think that all of this is just an illusion that we don't, like human cognition and perception constructs a whole, it's like a video game. It would construct that's very distant from the actual reality. And maybe one day we'll understand that reality. It may be like the matrix kind of thing. So there's a lot of different possibilities here. And there's also philosopher named Ernest Becker. I don't know if you know that is. He wrote Denou of Death and his idea. He disagrees with you, but he's dead now. Is that he thinks that the terror of death, the terror of the knowledge that we're going to die is within all of us. And is in fact the driver behind most of the creativity that we do. Exploring out into the universe, but also you becoming one of the great scholars of the martial arts, the philosophers of fighting is because you're actually terrified of death. And you want to somehow permeate your knowledge, your ideas, your essence to permeate human civilization so that even when your body dies, you live on. I would agree with him and so far as death is the single greatest motivator for action, but going beyond that and saying that it's somehow terrifying. It's an extra step on his part and not everyone's going to follow him on that step. I do believe that death is the single most important element in life that gives value to our days. If you think, for example, of a situation where a God came to you and gave you immortality, death would be very, very different for you. You're a talented research scientist. You work to a schedule. Why? Because ultimately, you know, your life is finite and actually very finite. And could be even more so if fate plays its hand and you die in early death or what have you, we never know what's going to happen tomorrow. As such, we get work done as soon as we can. The moment you gain immortality, you can always put every project off. You can always say, I don't need to do this today because I can do it four centuries from now. And as you extend artificially a human life, the motivation to get things done here and now and work industriously and excel fades away because you can always come back to the idea that you can do this in the future. And so what gives value to our days is ultimately death and value. It's not the only form of the reason behind value, but a huge part of what we consider value is scarcity. And death gives us scarcity of days. And it's probably the single greatest motivator for almost every action we've been taken. It's kind of tragic and beautiful that what makes things amazing is that they end. Yeah, I think it would actually be a terrible burden to be immortal. You would, life would be in many ways very hollow and meaningless, I think. People talk about death taking away the meaning of life, but I think immortality would have a very similar fate in a different direction. '

'Topic Header: Fear of death
John Danaher delves into the subject of mortality, distinguishing between the instinctual fear of death and the philosophical contemplation of non-existence post-mortem. Initially, he addresses the biological fear of death, 'If you throw me from the top of the Empire State Building, I'm going to scream all the way down... my body is terrified of injury leading to death,' reflecting on the instinctual survival responses shared by all humans. Delving deeper, Danaher questions the fear of non-existence post-mortem, likening our pre-birth non-existence to post-death, challenging the fear: 'You weren't afraid of the first period of non-existence... Why are you somehow afraid of the second?'

Danaher then considers the 'third death,' the point at which an individual's existence is forgotten by collective consciousness, mentioning the inevitable disappearance of significant contributions like Beethoven's symphonies. Despite acknowledging this inevitability, he finds solace in humanity's transient legacy, stating, 'it's crushing to think that there will come a time where no one will ever hear Beethoven symphonies again... but it's not even arrogance to say, I'm disappointed the idea that I will disappear.' Danaher references Elon Musk's vision of making humans a multiplanetary species as an exciting yet ultimately temporary defiance of mortality.

Danaher engages with Ernest Becker's theory from 'Denial of Death,' that the fear of mortality drives human creativity. He agrees that death is a motivator but argues against the notion that it instills universal terror, 'Death is the single greatest motivator for action... but to say it's somehow terrifying is an extra step.' He concludes with a reflection on the value of mortality, suggesting immortality would render life 'very hollow and meaningless,' as the scarcity of time gives life its meaning, 'What makes things amazing is that they end.'

Transcript 2:

' let me ask a big ridiculous question what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing we talked about at the beginning of the conversation and about death and the fear of it the other big question we ask about life is its meaning do you think there's a meaning to our existence here on this little spinning ball that's uh you you throw some some powerful questions that's the most powerful um for most of human existence the meaning of life was very very simple survival the only thing that humans cared about was just surviving because it was so damn difficult for the early years of human existence on this earth if you look at ourselves as biological agents everything about our body is set up for one mission and that is survival every reflex we have every element of our uh structure is just built up on the the battle to survive and then humans did something remarkable they elevated themselves through the use of technology and social structure to the top of the food chain so that they went from extremely vulnerable if you take a naked human being alone and put them in the serengeti planes in Africa they're in some deep shit okay if you look at a human being as a survival organism just by itself naked they are among the most feeble at that task an entire animal kingdom you compare us with predatory animals we are weak and soft and easily killed but if you take that same human and put them in a group and you give them basic technology and technology, steel, a spear, a knife he goes from the bottom of the food chain to pretty much at the top and so humanity found itself in a crisis that emerged out of its own success for most of its history their only interest was the battle to survive and they they did it i didn't know how they did it but they did it they got through ice ages droughts famines disease everything and they found a way to get to the top of the food chain and that's where it all got interesting because that organism whose only interest was in survival had for the first time in their history a more or less guaranteed survival and so the big question now is now what we survived there's no more danger the average human being finds himself in a world now where there's almost zero danger from predatory animals where getting a meal is the easiest thing ever we're getting two and from work it's not problematic at all where the majority of infectious diseases medical complaints can be resolved in a hospital fairly easily and so they start casting their mind around okay what do i do now and so the minute mankind's existence became more or less guaranteed the problem shift from survival to meaning and we found ourselves grappling with a whole new issue that had never occurred to our ancient forefathers but which now becomes one of the centerpieces of our modern lives i mean when you look at your own life when you look back that you think i did a hell of a good job you know uh hunter esthamsen has this line that i often think about that life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in roadside in a cloud of smoke thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride that's great which is the complete opposite of survival we're not complete opposite of survival but basically embracing danger embracing risk going big just living life to the fullest so within that context what would make you proud of a life well lived when you look back you john donnaheart looking back at your life first i will address that question but let's first look at why hunter Thompson could say that because his life was morally guaranteed and safe if you look at animals in the animal kingdom the pattern of their life is very simple they take the least risk possible to secure their existence lions are powerful creatures but when they go hunting they typically go for the weakest animals they can kill in order to eat because they don't want to take the risk of injuring themselves knowing that if they do they die so the brute reality is the only people who can talk about having casual danger and their lives are those whose lives are guaranteed in a fascinating small tangent hunter Thompson took his own life so that's that seems like a deeply human thing the suicide yes that's a fascinating question in itself if you look at the the number of suicides per year it's a shocking shocking statistic that gets almost no recognition and yes uniquely human you don't very very few animals you see killing themselves because the whole thing is just survival and that humans paradoxically when survival is more or less guaranteed at killing themselves and vast numbers it's usually linked back to the idea of meaning because it's so hard it's it was hard to win the battle for survival but it's 10 times harder to win the battle for meaning when I think about first of all I'll say right from the bad there's never going to be an agreed upon sense of meaning as as I said there was one thing that our physical bodies agreed upon and which is hard-wired biologically into us and that's survival but once we got to a more or less guaranteed survival then all bets were off at that point you just have to start listing your own criteria and what one person will describe as a meaningful life another person will decry as meaningless or wasted there's something terrible about the idea that we're sitting waiting for meaning to show up on our doorstep but what I find the best people do is they take charge of it and they they look at their lives in a form of authorship where they see their life as a tale to be written and they do their best to write that tale and put as much control over the the direction of this story as they can in the end we all have to just try and write our own story we all have our own interests I try to bring in the sense that even though I'm an atheist I don't believe that we go on to live after this I believe that this a possibility of a God and after life I don't say it's impossible but in order for me to believe that they exist I'd have to see better evidence than I see currently nonetheless I do believe that there is a great value in the idea of living for something bigger than yourself the moment you see yourself as the be all and end all of your existence you're in for a meaningless life and nothing will ever satisfy you you can have all the money in the world you can have all the power in the world you'll be empty inside I do believe that humans have a deep and abiding need to follow the interests of a group bigger than themselves as an individual is it ideal no is it an answer to the meaning of life nope because eventually that group will itself die out so there's a sense in which it it just plays a kind of delaying game but I do believe that in order to live a happy life meaning as a central part of that and the deepest sense of meaning not a fully complete answer but a better answer than most people give us to to find something which hopefully does very little harm to the people around you and mostly benefits them which enables you to become part of a community and to live as I say it for something larger than you as an individual if there is such a thing as a perfect conversation it would be a conversation on death meaning and robots with the great John Donahar John Abin Affin is a huge honor that you would waste all your time today thank you so much for talking today my pleasure thank you links thanks for listening to this conversation with John Donahar and thank you to on it simply safe indeed and linoid check them out in the description to support this podcast and now let me leave you some words from John Donahar himself in fighting and competition the objective is victory in training the objective is skill development to not confuse them as such one of the best ways to train is to identify the strengths of your various partners and regularly expose yourself to those strengths thank you for listening and hope to see you next time'

'Topic Header: Meaning of life
John Danaher explores the profound question of life's meaning, reflecting on humanity's journey from survival as the primal goal to seeking purpose beyond mere existence. He asserts, 'For most of human existence, the meaning of life was very simple: survival.' Danaher highlights the shift that occurred as humans ascended the food chain through technology and social structures, transitioning from survival mode to a quest for purpose, 'Humanity found itself in a crisis that emerged out of its own success...the big question now is, now what?'

Danaher contrasts the historical survival-centric life with the modern human experience, where survival is largely assured, prompting individuals to seek meaning and purpose. He quotes Hunter S. Thompson, 'Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming 'Wow! What a ride!'' This quote contrasts the primal drive for survival with a modern inclination towards embracing life's richness and risks.

Addressing what makes a life well-lived, Danaher suggests looking at life as a story to be authored, where individuals take charge of their narrative, seeking to contribute to something greater than themselves, 'I do believe that humans have a deep and abiding need to follow the interests of a group bigger than themselves.' He emphasizes the importance of living for a cause beyond individual gain, 'The moment you see yourself as the be all and end all of your existence, you're in for a meaningless life.'

Furthermore, Danaher touches on the perplexity of suicide in a world where survival is given, linking it to the overarching crisis of meaning. He suggests that the act of taking one's life, despite the assuredness of survival, underscores the profound challenge of finding purpose.'

'If this is where you want to be investing, I don't think. 800 million could pay for a lot of credits, which probably gets you one step closer to the answer. Or at Reddit, when public today, they have 800 million in revenue. Company is worth over $8 billion in trading. It's a 50%. What do you think? The opening of the IPO window again. So so one off gets try upcoming and what do you take from it popping 50% on the first day? I don't know. I really haven't looked at the company. I haven't looked at the financials. But like these last three or four weeks, I think people have been so excited and rearing to go. We're in the middle of another meme coin craze. I don't think we are all getting pulled into that nonsense. I think the point is that I think there is a speculative party going on right now. And I'm not saying that Reddit is part of it. But whenever these things are so mispriced, just means that people are ready to gamble a little bit. There's definitely a lot of gambling in the system as we've seen. And we're recording this on Thursday. So who knows what the stock price will be tomorrow? Generally. By the way, the other thing is like, how old did say finally, it looks pretty likely we're going to get these three cuts. So we're going to be down to four and a half to four, seven, five on Fed funds by the end of the year. It probably means that we'll get another 50 to 75 basis points to 2025. So people will look out to the end of 2025 and look at a Fed funds rate that's sort of like three, seven, five to four percent. So they're getting pretty excited and frothed up. So this is the beginning of the beginning in terms of that kind of speculation. Yeah. We saw crypto go bonkers the last couple of weeks. Yeah. What's your take on all this? Sacks as if you feel like people are in gamble mode again. And does that concern you, I guess, after what we just experienced? Well, I think they're pricing in these rate cuts as if they're definitely going to happen. Like Jemosat, I think the market's expectation is with, let's call it, 70 percent certainty that you're going to get three rate cuts this year. And it still seems to me that that's a little bit up in the air because inflation has not come down to the Fed's target of 2 percent. It's still right around 3 percent, 3.1 percent. So it's been sticky around 3 percent. It was coming down pretty fast last year, but it's still there. So people I think are maybe gambling in the sense that they're counting on rate cuts that haven't happened yet. But they liked Powell's dovish rhetoric yesterday. And they seem to think that that means that the rate cuts are definitely coming. I don't know how Powell can promise that without inflation coming down unless he's trying to create a Biden put. There it is, folks. Which was my theory going into this year, is that? Yeah. Is that we get a Biden put from the Fed? Absolutely. And it's looking like Biden has a clear path to victory based on the lowest unemployment of our lifetimes in this worrying stock market records. Yeah. It's just an easy Biden victory. Freeberg, what do you think about the risk on? I don't know. Biden is incredibly unpopular. If you look at his actual polling, he should not win the election. But that's in spite of your right. The economy seems to be doing pretty well. Stock market's certainly doing pretty well. A president with these fundamentals would normally get reelected. But Biden currently is not, his polling is not the polling of a president who's going to get reelected. It is pretty amazing. It becomes, if Powell comes through with the rate cuts, that will help him. It's pretty amazing how horrible a job he's doing that he's made Trump look like a better candidate to some people. That is an extraordinary achievement by Biden. And we'll have to agree there. Like I think the bigger economic issue to be talking about was that buried article in the Wall Street Journal about commercial real estate. Do you see that article? That was crazy. So this Wall Street Journal article reported that of the 36 billion of office loans that came to you in the commercial mortgage back securities market last year, only one quarter were paid off and full. That's according to data from Real Estate Analytics from CRED 10. Is that extended pretend strategy that you see there? Yeah. Only one quarter of the loans got paid off. So 75% didn't get paid off and full. So there's tons of buildings that are underwater right now. But nobody wants to foreclose and then sell them at a fire sale price. So yeah, everyone is it's pretend to extend. Yeah. Kick them a can down the road. Nobody wants to take the medicine. Well, they're hoping that rates will come down fast enough and occupancy rates will go up fast enough that no one has to foreclose. But if rates don't come down, then you have a real problem. I mean, again, everyone is just assuming that inflation will continue its path from 3% to 2% and then we'll get these rate cuts. And they're hoping they can cling on. Landlords are clinging on and I think the banks that loan them all this money are clinging on for dear life. But if rates stay higher longer, then you're going to see some real distress. Including the regional banking system. Freeberg, you had a science corner here. A couple of different things came up.'

'Topic Header: Reddit IPO: is risk-on back?
The discussion touches on Reddit's IPO, where the company, with $800 million in revenue, hit an $8 billion valuation after a 50% stock price jump on the first day. This event sparks a conversation about investor speculation and the re-opening of the IPO market. Amidst a broader context of market excitement, including a new meme coin craze, there's a shared concern over speculative investments and their implications.

The conversation shifts to Federal Reserve rate cuts, with expectations of a decrease to 3.75-4% by 2025, driving market enthusiasm despite ongoing inflation concerns around 3%. This leads to speculation about a potential 'Biden put' to support the economy ahead of elections, despite President Biden's low approval ratings contrasted with a strong economy and stock market performance.

A significant part of the discussion centers on commercial real estate's challenges, highlighted by a report that only a quarter of office loans were fully repaid last year, suggesting many properties are financially underwater. This situation points to a broader economic risk, especially if high interest rates persist, impacting landlords and possibly straining the banking sector.'

Transcript 4:

"You've spoken honestly about the possibility of war between US and China in the long term, if no diplomatic solution is found. For example, on the question of Taiwan and one China policy, how do we avoid the trajectory where these two superpowers clash? Well, it's worth reading that book on the difficult to pronounce. The Saturdays trap, I believe it's called. I love war history. I like inside out in backwards. There's hardly a battle I haven't read about. And trying to figure out what really was the cause of victory in any particular case, as opposed to what one side or another claimed for the reason. So it's called the victory in what sparked the war. Yeah, yeah. So that Athens and Sparta is a classic case. The thing about the Greeks is they really wrote down a lot of stuff. They loved writing. There are lots of interesting things that happen in many parts of the world, but they just feel it isn't right down. So we don't know what happened. Or they didn't really write in detail. But you can add a bit more. The Greeks, they really wrote a lot. They're very articulate on, they just love writing. And we have a bunch of that writing that's preserved. So we know what led up to the Peloponnesian War between the Spartan and Athenian Alliance. And we know that they saw it coming. The Spartans didn't write, they also weren't very focused by their nature. But they did write, but they weren't very focused. They weren't tourists. But the Athenians and the other Greeks wrote a line. And they were like, and Sparta was really kind of like the leader of Greece. But Athens grew stronger and stronger with each passing year. And everyone's like, well, that's inevitable that there's going to be a clash of Athens and Sparta. Well, how do we avoid that? And they actually saw it coming and they still could not avoid it. So at some point, if there's, if one group won civilization or country or whatever, exceeds another sort of like, the United States has been the biggest kid in the block since, I think, 2018-90 from an economic standpoint. So the United States has been the economic, most powerful economic engine in the world longer than anyone's been alive. And the foundation of war is economics. So now we have a situation in the case of trying to wear the economy is likely to be two, perhaps three times larger than that of the US. So imagine you're the biggest kid in the block, for as long as anyone can remember. And suddenly, a kid comes along who swice your size. So we see it coming. Yeah. How is it possible to stop? Let me throw something out there, just intermixed thing of culture's understanding. There just seem to be a giant cultural gap in understanding of each other. And you're an interesting case study because you are an American. Obviously you've done a lot of incredible manufacture here in the United States, but you also work with China. I've spent a lot of time in China and met with the leadership many times. A big good question to ask is, what are some things about China that people don't understand, positive, just in the culture, what some interesting things that you've learned about the Chinese? Well, the sheer number of really smart, hardworking people in China is incredible. There are, I believe, say like how many smart, hardworking people are in China just far more than there than they are here. I think in my opinion. The, and I've got a lot of energy. So, I mean, the architecture in China that's in recent years is far more impressive than the US. I mean, the train stations, the buildings, the high speed rail, everything. It's really far more impressive than what we have in the US. I mean, I recommend somebody just go to Shanghai and Beijing. Look at the buildings and go to take the train from Beijing to Xian, where you have the Terracotta Warriors. I'm Chinese, got an incredible history, very long history. And, you know, I think arguably the, in terms of the use of language from a written standpoint, sort of one of the oldest paths, perhaps the oldest written language. And then China, people did write things down. Now China, historically, has always been, with the rare exception, been internally focused. They've not been a positive. They've fought each other. There have been many, many civil wars. And the three kingdoms were, I believe, they lost about 70% of their population. So, they had brutal internal wars. Like civil wars that make the US of all look small by comparison. So, I think it's important to appreciate that China is not monolithic. We sort of think of China as one entity, well, one mind. And this is definitely not the case. From what I've seen, and I think most people who understand China would agree, people in China think about China 10 times more than they think about anything outside of China. So, it's like 90% of their consideration is, you know, our art is in total. Well, isn't that a really positive thing when you're talking about the collaboration and the future piece between superpowers, when you're inward facing, which is like focusing on improving yourself versus focusing on, yeah, quote unquote, improving others through military might. The good news, the history of China suggests that China is not a positive, meaning they're not going to go out and invade a whole bunch of countries. They do feel very strongly, you know, so that's good. I mean, because a lot of very powerful countries have been a positive. The US is also one of the rare cases that has not been a positive. Like an out-of-world war two, the US could have basically taken over the world in any country. Like we got New York's, nobody else got New York's. You know, we have to lose soldiers. Which country do you want? And the United States could have taken over everything. Or it, well, and it didn't. And the United States actually helped revolt countries. It's helped revolt Europe, you know, help revolt Japan. This is a very unusual behavior, almost unprecedented. You know, the US did conspicuous acts of kindness, like the Berlin Air Lift. You know. And I think, you know, it's always like, well, America's done bad things. Well, of course, America's done bad things. But one needs to look at the whole track record. And just generally, you know, one one sort of test would be, how do you treat your prisoners of war? Or let's say, you know, no offense to the Russians, but let's say you're in Germany, it's 1945. You got the Russian army coming one side, and you got the French, British and American armies coming the other side. Who would you like to be just right or two? Like, no country is like, morally perfect, but I recommend being a POW with the Americans. That would be my choice very strongly. In the full menu of POW, watch. And in fact, one of our brown, you know, a small guy was like, we've got to be captured by the Americans. And in fact, the SS was under orders to execute one brown and all of the German rock niches. And they narrowly escaped their SS. They said they were going out for a walk in the woods. They left in the middle of winter with no coats. And they ran like ever no food, no coats, no water. And just ran like hell and ran west. And by sheer luck, they, I think his brother found like a bicycle or something. And they just cycled west as fast as he could and found a US patrol. So anyway, let's look, let's one way you can tell morality. We're doing one of the APW. It's not fun anywhere, but some places are much worse than others. So anyway, so like America has been well far from perfect, generally a benevolent force. And we should always be self-critical and try to be better. But anyone will have a right to know that. So I think there are, in this way, China and the United States are similar. Neither country has been a positive in a significant way. So that's like a shared principle, I guess. Now China does feel very strongly about Taiwan. They've been very clear about that for a long time. From this standpoint, it would be like one of the states is not there like Hawaii or something like that. But more significant than Hawaii. Hawaii is pretty significant for us. They've heard it as really the fundamental part of China, the island of Formosa, not Taiwan, that is not part of China, but should be. And the only reason it hasn't been is because of the US Pacific fleet. And is there economic power growth? And is there military power growth? The thing that they are clearly saying, is there interest will clearly be materialized? Yes. China has been very clear that they will incorporate Taiwan peacefully or militarily. But that they will incorporate it from this standpoint is 100% likely. Now something you said about conspicuous acts of kindness. As a geopolitical policy, it almost seems naive. But I'd venture to say that this is probably the path forward, how you avoid most wars. Just as you say it, it sounds naive, but it's kind of brilliant. If you believe in the goodness of underlying most of human nature, it just seems like conspicuous acts of kindness can reverberate through the populace of the countries involved. Yeah. Well, and de-escalate. Absolutely. So after World War I, they made a big mistake. They basically try to lump all the blame on Germany. And it settled Germany with impossible reparations. And there was quite a bit of blame to go around for World War I. But they put it all in Germany. And that laid the seeds for World War II. So a lot of people were not just Hitler, a lot of people felt wronged. And they wanted vengeance. And they got it. People don't forget. You kill somebody's father, mother, son, daughter, they're not going to forget it. They will want vengeance. So after World War II, they're like, well, that Treaty of Si was a huge mistake. It will rule one. And so this time instead of crushing the losers, we're actually going to help them with the Marshall Plan. And we're going to help rebuild Germany. We're going to help rebuild Austria and Italy and whatnot. And that was the right move. There's a, it does feel like there's a profound truth to a conspicuous acts of kindness being an antidote to this. Something must stop the cycle of reciprocal violence. Something must stop it. Or it will, you know, it'll, it'll, it'll never stop. I for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, limb for a limb, life for a life, forever and ever. To escape briefly the darkness was some incredible engineering work."

"Topic Header: China

Elon Musk discusses the looming potential for conflict between the US and China, specifically over Taiwan, talking about the concept of the Thucydides Trap to underscore historical patterns where rising powers challenge established ones. Musk, an avid war history enthusiast, asserts, "There's hardly a battle I haven't read about," emphasizing his comprehensive study of warfare to understand the true drivers of conflict versus the victors' narratives. He draws parallels with the Peloponnesian War, noting the extensive historical record left by the Greeks, particularly the Athenians, and the inevitability of conflict they foresaw yet couldn't prevent between Athens and Sparta.

Musk emphasizes the economic foundations of war, noting, "The foundation of war is economics.” Despite the US being the largest economic power since the late 19th century, he projects China's economy to potentially triple the size of the US's, fundamentally altering the global power dynamic. Musk expresses concern over the inevitability of conflict when an ascending power challenges an established one, stating, "Imagine you're the biggest kid on the block, for as long as anyone can remember. And suddenly, a kid comes along who's twice your size."

Addressing cultural misunderstandings between the US and China, Musk highlights the vast number of "smart, hardworking people in China" and their recent architectural achievements, suggesting these aspects are often overlooked in the West. He admires China's long history and written language, acknowledging the country's predominantly internal focus throughout history and its limited outward aggression. He suggests that both the US and China suffer from a lack of mutual cultural understanding, which could be pivotal in de-escalating tensions.

Musk suggests that mutual understanding and respect for each country's achievements and cultural depth could form a basis for peace. He proposes "conspicuous acts of kindness" as a strategy to break the cycle of violence, drawing a lesson from the outcomes of the Treaty of Versailles post-World War I with the Marshall Plan post-World War II. Regarding the Treaty of Versailles, Musk criticizes its punitive stance towards Germany: "They basically tried to lump all the blame on Germany... And it settled Germany with impossible reparations." This approach, in Musk's view, directly contributed to the conditions that led to World War II, as it fostered resentment and a desire for vengeance among the German population.

In contrast, Musk praises the post-World War II Marshall Plan, highlighting its role in reconstructing Europe through acts of generosity rather than retribution: "Instead of crushing the losers, we're actually going to help them... And we're going to help rebuild Germany." This strategy not only facilitated Europe's recovery but also prevented the cycle of revenge that followed the first world war. Musk advocates for this approach not only as a means to prevent conflict but as a way to foster a more peaceful and collaborative international environment, concluding, "Something must stop the cycle of reciprocal violence... Or it will never stop.""

" To escape briefly the darkness was some incredible engineering work. XAI just released GROC, AI assistant that I've gotten a chance to play with. It's amazing on many levels. First of all, it's amazing that a relatively small team in a relatively short amount of time was able to develop this close to state of the art system. Another incredible thing is there's a regular mode and there's a fun mode. Yeah, I guess I'm too playing for that one. First of all, everything in life had a fun mode. Yeah. I mean, there's something compelling beyond just fun about the fun mode interacting with a large language model. I'm not sure exactly what it is because I've only had a little bit of time to play with it. But it just makes it more interesting, more vibrant to interact with the system. Yeah. Absolutely. Our AI GROC is modeled after the Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy, which is one of my favorite books, which is a book on philosophy disguises a book on humor. And I would say that forms the basis of my philosophy, which is that we don't know the meaning of life. But the more we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, digital and biological, the more we are able to understand what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe. So I have a philosophy of curiosity. There is generally a feeling like this AI system has an outward looking like the way you are like sitting with a good friend looking up at the stars, like asking podhead questions about the universe wondering what it's all about, the curiosity to talk about. There's a sense, no matter how mundane the question I ask it, there's a sense of cosmic grandeur to the whole thing. We are actually working hard to have engineering, math, physics answers that you can count on. So for the other sort of AIs out there that were so-called large language models, I've not found the engineering to be reliable. And it's the hallucination, it's, unfortunately, hallucination most when you at least wanted to hallucinate. So when you're asking important difficult questions, that's when it tends to be confidently wrong. So we're really trying hard to say, okay, how do we be as grounded as possible so you can count on the results? So we're trying to trace things back to physics first principles, mathematical logic. So underlying the humor is an aspiration to adhere to the truth of the universe as closely as possible. That's really tricky. It is tricky. That's why there's always going to be some amount of error, but we want to aspire to be as truthful as possible about the answers with acknowledged error. So that there was always, you don't want to be confidently wrong. So you're not going to be right every time, but you want to minimize how often you're confidently wrong. And then like I said, once you can count on the logic as being not violating physics, then you can start to pull on that to create inventions, like invent new technologies. But if you can't count on the foundational physics being correct, obviously the inventions are simply wishful thinking, you know, imagination-land. That's magic basically. Well, as you said, I think one of the big goals of XAI is to understand the universe. Yes. That's a simple three word mission. If you look out far into the future, do you think on this level of physics, the very edge of what we understand about physics, do you think it will make discoveries? Sort of the sexy as discovery of them as we know now, sort of unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics. So coming up with a theory of everything, do you think it could push towards that direction, almost like theoretical physics discoveries? If an AI cannot figure out new physics, it's clearly not equal to humans. That'll not know how to pass humans because humans have figured out new physics. Physics is just understanding, you know, deepening what's inside it, how reality works. And then, then this engineering, which is inventing things that have never existed. Now, the range of possibilities for engineering is far greater than physics, because, you know, we once you forgot the rules of the universe, that's it. You've discovered things that already existed. But from that, you can then build technologies with that are really almost limitless in the variety and, you know, sequentially understand the rules of the game properly. And we do, you know, with current physics, we do, at least at a local level, understand how physics works very well. We are related to predict things is incredibly good. Like quantum mechanics is the degree to which quantum mechanics can predict outcomes is incredible. That's my hardest class in college, by the way. My C at quantum mechanics class was harder than all of my other classes were together. To get an AI system, a large language model to reliably be as reliable as quantum mechanics and physics is very difficult. Yeah, you have to test any conclusions against the ground truth of reality, reality is the ultimate judge. Like physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation. I've seen plenty of people break the laws made by man, but none break the laws made by physics. It's a good test, actually. If this LM understands and matches physics, then you can more reliably trust whatever it thinks about the current state of politics. And it's also not the case currently that even that it's internal logic is not consistent. So, especially with these, with the approach of like just predicting a token predict token predict token. It's like a vector sum, you know, you're summing up a bunch of vectors, but you can get drift. So, as those a little bit of error, a little bit of error adds up. And by the time you are made tokens down the path, it doesn't make any sense. So, it has to be somehow self-aware about the drift. It has to be self-aware about the drift and then look at the thing as a Gestalt, as a whole. And say it doesn't have coherence as a whole. So, you know, when authors write books that they will write the book and then they'll go and revise it, you know, taking into account the end of the beginning and the middle and re-write it to achieve coherence. So, it doesn't end up in an auntensical place. Maybe the process of revising is what? Yeah. Reasoning is, and then that's the process of revising is how you get closer and closer to truth. Maybe you, like, at least I approach it that way. You just say a bunch of bullshit first and then you get it better. You start a bullshit and then you get this close. And then you iterate on that draft until it has coherence, until it all adds up basically. So, another question about theory of everything before intelligence. Do you think there exists, as your exploring this with XAI, creating this intelligence system? Do you think there is a theory of intelligence, where you get to understand what is the eye in AGI and what is the eye in human intelligence? There's no eye in Team America, away from there. And now it's going to be stuck in my head now. Yeah. There's no me and whatever. In quantum mechanics, oh wait. Is that part of the process of discovering understanding the universe, understanding intelligence? Yeah. Yeah, I think we need to understand intelligence, understand consciousness. There are some fundamental questions of like, what is thought, what is emotion? Is it really just one atom bumping into another atom? It feels like something more than that. So, I think we're probably missing some really big things. Like some really big things. Something that will be obvious in retrospect. Is it a giant? You put the whole consciousness in motion? Well, something that would quote like a soul, in a religion of a soul. Like, you feel like you're you, right? I mean, you don't feel like you're just a collection of atoms. But on what dimension does thought exist? What dimensions do emotions exist? We feel them very strongly. I suspect there's more to it than atoms bumping into atoms. And maybe AI can pave the path to the discovery of what, whatever the hell that thing is. Yeah. What is consciousness? Like what, when you put the atoms in a particular shape, why are they able to form thoughts and take actions that enter, enter feelings? And even if it is an illusion, why is this illusion so compelling? Yeah. Like how do you think? The solution exists. Yeah. On what plane does this, the solution exists? Yeah. And that sometimes I wonder is, you know, either perhaps everything is conscious or nothing is conscious. One of the two. I like the former. Everything conscious just seems more fun. It does seem more fun, yes. But we're composed of atoms. And those atoms are composed of quarks and leptons. And those quarks and leptons have been around since the beginning of the universe. The beginning of the universe. Right. What's here to be the beginning of the universe? The first time we talked, you said what you would, which is surreal to think that this discussion was happening is becoming a reality."

"Topic Header 13: xAI Grok
In a thought-provoking conversation on the Lex Friedman podcast, Elon Musk delved into the nuances of AI development, specifically discussing XAI's creation, GROC—an AI assistant showcasing both utility and an engaging "fun mode." Musk praised the team's achievement in developing this advanced system quickly and the unique appeal of interacting with AI in a more vibrant, engaging manner. Highlighting the philosophical underpinnings of his work, Musk drew inspiration from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," emphasizing the expansion of consciousness, both digital and biological, as a means to deepen our understanding of the universe.

Musk critiqued existing AI for its unreliability and propensity for "hallucinations" when addressing complex queries. "We're really trying hard to say, okay, how do we be as grounded as possible so you can count on the results?" Musk explained, highlighting the aim to reduce confidently wrong answers and base innovation on robust scientific principles.

Looking toward the future, Musk speculated on AI's potential to revolutionize our understanding of physics, hinting at the possibility of AI making significant theoretical physics discoveries, such as unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics. Such advancements, he noted, would mark AI's capability to surpass human intellect in understanding and inventing within the realm of physics. He pondered the profound questions of intelligence and consciousness, challenging the nature of thought and emotion beyond mere physical interactions. He speculates that there might be more to these phenomena than just atoms bumping into atoms, stating, "What dimensions do emotions exist? We feel them very strongly." He hints at a significant gap in our understanding of how consciousness emerges from the arrangement of atoms and poses questions about the existence of consciousness in all things, suggesting a philosophical perspective that extends beyond traditional physics."

" Yeah. So like I said, somehow controversially you've been a proponent of peace on Twitter, on X. Yeah. So let me ask you about the wars going on today and to see what the path to peace could be. How do you hope the current war in Israel and Gaza comes to an end? What path do you see that can minimize human suffering in the long term in that part of the world? Well, I think that probably the world is... Definitely, if you look up the... There is no easy answer in dictionary. It'll be that picture of the Middle East in Israel especially. So there is no easy answer. Or what my... This is strictly my opinion of... Is that the goal of Moss was to provoke an overreaction from Israel. They obviously do not expect to have a military victory, but they really wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel. And then leverage that aggressive response to rally Muslims worldwide for the cause of Gaza and Palestine, which they have succeeded in doing. So the counter-intuitive thing here, I think that the thing that I think should be done, even though it's very difficult, is that... I would recommend that Israel engage in the most conspicuous acts of kindness possible, every part, everything. That is the actual thing that would thwart the goal of Moss. So in some sense, does it agree that makes sense in geopolitics turning the other cheek implemented? It's not exactly turning the other cheek, because I do think that there's... I think it is appropriate for Israel to find the Moss members, and either kill them or accostrate them. That's something that has to be done, because they're just going to keep coming otherwise. But in addition to that, they need to do whatever they can. There's some talk of establishing, for example, a mobile hospital. I'd recommend doing that. Just making sure that this food, water, medical necessities, and just be over the top about it, and be very transparent. So people can't claim it's a trick. Just put a way of camera on the thing. 24-7. Deploy acts of kindness. Yes, conspicuous acts of kindness. That are unequivocal. I mean, they can't be somehow... Because the Moss will then... their response will be always a trick. Therefore, you have to counter how it is not a trick. This ultimately fights the broader force of hatred in the region. Yes. I'm not sure who said it to some of our Procurement saying, but an eye for an eye makes everyone blind. Now, that neck of the woods, they really believe in the whole eye for an eye thing. But if you're not going to just outright commit genocide against an entire people, which I would not be acceptable to be acceptable to anyone, then you're going to leave a lot of people alive who subsequently hate Israel. Really, the question is, for every Hamas member that you kill, how many did you create? And if you create more than you kill, you've not succeeded. That's the real situation there. And it's safe to say that if... If you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you've made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill Israeli. That's the situation. But this is one of the most contentious subjects one could possibly discuss. I think if the goal is long term peace, one has to be looked at this from standpoint of over time, are there more or fewer terrorists being created? Let me just link on war. Yeah. War would say, war existed and always will exist. Always will exist. Always has existed and always will exist. I hope not. You think it always will. This question of how much will and what... There's the scope and scale of war. But to my attention that there would not be any more in the future, I think would be very unlikely outcome. You talked about the culture series. There's war even there. Yes. The giant war. The first book starts off with a gigantic galactic war where trillions die. But it still nevertheless protects these pockets of flourishing. Somehow you can have galactic war and still have pockets of flourishing. Yeah. I guess if we are able to one day to expand to full the galaxy or whatever, there will be a galactic war at some point. The scale of war has been increasing and increasing. It's like a race between the scale of suffering and the scale of flourishing. Yes. A lot of people seem to be using this tragedy to beat the drums of war and feed the military industrial complex. Do you worry about this? The people who are rooting for escalation and how can it be stopped?"

"Topic Header: Israel-Hamas war
In discussing the Israel-Hamas conflict, Elon Musk offers a nuanced view on achieving peace in a region steeped in historical conflict. He suggests, "The goal of Hamas was to provoke an overreaction from Israel," aiming to unify global Muslim support through showcasing Israeli aggressions. Musk proposes an unconventional peace strategy for Israel: "engage in the most conspicuous acts of kindness possible." He elaborates on tangible measures like establishing mobile hospitals and ensuring access to essential resources such as food, water, and medical supplies. Musk emphasizes the importance of transparency in these acts, suggesting, "Just put a webcam on the thing, 24/7," to dispel any notions of deceit.

Musk candidly discusses the dynamics of retaliation and its counterproductive nature, quoting, "an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind," to criticize the cycle of violence and its failure to resolve the underlying issues. He points out the paradox of targeting Hamas members, questioning, "for every Hamas member that you kill, how many did you create?" This reflects his deeper contemplation on the counterintuitive outcomes of military actions and the necessity of a strategic shift toward kindness and humanitarian aid.

Reflecting on the broader theme of conflict, Musk acknowledges the seemingly inherent nature of war, stating, "War has always existed and always will exist." He draws from Iain M. Banks' Culture series to illustrate the inevitability and scale of war, even in futuristic galactic societies. Yet, Musk highlights the critical balance between "the scale of suffering and the scale of flourishing," underscoring the potential to sustain growth and prosperity even amidst conflict.

Musk expresses concern over the exploitation of the tragedy to "beat the drums of war and feed the military-industrial complex," urging a discernment between calls for escalation and genuine pursuits of peace. "

" The following is a conversation with Elon Musk. His fourth time on this, the Lex Friedman podcast. I thought you were going to finish it. It's one of the greatest themes in all film history. Yeah, that's great. I was just thinking about the Roman Empire. That's what it does. Does that whole meme where all guys are thinking about the Roman Empire at least once a day? Half the population is confused whether it's true or not. But more seriously, thinking about the wars going on in the world today. As you know, war and military conquest has been a big part of Roman society and culture. I think it's been a big part of most empires and dynasty throughout human history. They usually came as a result of conquest. There's something like the Oshiro and Garene Empire where there was just a lot of clever marriages. Fundamentally, there's an engine of conquest and they celebrate excellence in warfare. Many of the leaders were excellent generals. That kind of thing. Big picture question. Grakha proved. I asked this is a good question to ask. Did Tesla Grakha prove? At least on fun mode. To what degree do you think war is part of human nature versus a consequence of how human societies are structured? I asked this as you have somehow controversially been a proponent of peace. I've generally proponent of peace. I mean, ignorance is perhaps, in my view, the real enemy to be countered. That's the real hard part, not fighting other humans. But all creatures fight. The jungle is a... You look at the... You'll think of this nature as perhaps some sort of peaceful thing, but in fact, it is not. Some quite funny, when a hot talk thing where he's in the jungle, saying that it's basically just murder and death in every direction. I mean, the plants and animals in the jungle are constantly trying to kill each other every single day, every minute. So it's not like we're unusual in their respect. There's a relevant question here whether with greater intelligence comes greater control over these base instincts for violence. Yes. We have much more vulnerability to control our... ...lambig instinct for violence than say, chimpanzee. And in fact, if one looks at say, chimpanzee society, it is not friendly. I mean, the bonobos are an exception. But chimpanzee society is full of violence and it's quite horrific, frankly. That's our limbic system in action. Like you know what would be on the wrong side of a chimpanzee, you'll eat your face off or tear or not so. Yeah, basically there's no limits or ethics or... They're almost at just war. There's no just war in chimpanzee societies. It's war and dominance by any means necessary. Yeah, chimpanzee society is a primitive version of human society. They're not like peace loving, basically, at all. There's extreme violence. And then once in a while somebody who's watched too many Disney movies decides to raise chimpanzee as a pet, then that eats their face or if they're not so awful, choose their fingers off or that kind of thing. It's happened several times. Ripping your not so often is an interesting strategy for interaction. It's happened to people that's unfortunate. I guess one way to ensure that the other chimpanzee doesn't contribute to the gene pool. Well, from a martial arts perspective, it's a fascinating strategy. The nut ripper. I wonder which of the martial arts teachers that... I think it's safe to say if somebody's got your nuts in their hands. And as the option of rubbing them off, you will be amenable to whatever they want. Yeah. So like I said, somehow controversially you've been a proponent of peace on Twitter, on X. Yeah. So let me ask you about the wars going on today and to see what the path to peace could be."

In a deep dive on the Lex Friedman podcast, Elon Musk reflects on the role of warfare through history, drawing an intriguing parallel to the Roman Empire and the intrinsic violence of the natural world. Musk muses, "Does that whole meme where all guys are thinking about the Roman Empire at least once a day? Half the population is confused whether it's true or not," when discussing the ubiquitous nature of conflict, from human societies to the animal kingdom. He specifically mentions the Oshiro and Garene Empires, noting their unique expansion through "clever marriages" rather than the typical conquests emblematic of most empires.

Addressing the nature of war, Musk posits, "Ignorance is perhaps, in my view, the real enemy to be countered," suggesting that the battle against ignorance is paramount over engaging in conflict with fellow humans. He draws a vivid comparison with the animal world, stating, "The jungle is...just murder and death in every direction." Musk delves into the dark side of animal behavior, especially among chimpanzees, contrasting their violent dominance with human capabilities for emotional and intellectual restraint. Citing a stark example, Musk recalls, "Once in a while somebody who's watched too many Disney movies decides to raise a chimpanzee as a pet, then that eats their face off."

Through Musk's exploration of these themes, he challenges listeners to consider the deeper roots of conflict and the potential for peace. "

" So given this short life, we can think about Jiu Jitsu, we can think about any kind of pursuit. What do you think makes a great life? Is it the highest peak of achievement? You think about like an Olympic gold medal, the highest level of performance? Where is it the longevity of performance of doing many amazing things and doing it for a long time? I think the latter is kind of what we talk about in at least American society. We want people to be healthy, balanced, perform well for a long time. And then there's maybe like the gladiator ethic, which is the highest peak is what defines. You asked an initial question, which what makes a great life, but then pointed towards two options, one of longevity versus other other options. There's got to be a lot more than that, surely. I mean, think about, first of all, we have to understand from the start, there's never going to be an agreed upon set of criteria. But this is a great life from all perspective. If you look from the perspective of, say, Mucky Evali, then Stalin lived a great life. He was highly successful at what he did. He started from nothing. So the degree of difficulty in what he did was extraordinarily high. He had massive impact upon world history. He oversaw the defeat of almost all of his major enemies. He lived to old age and died of natural causes. So from Mucky Evali's point of view, he had a great life. If you ask a Ukrainian farmer in the 1930s, whether he lived a great life, you get a very different answer. So everything's going to come from what perspective you begin with this. You're going to look out at the world with a given point of view and you're going to make your judgments. Was this a great life or was this a terrible life? Going back to your point, you were actually, I think, focusing the question on more in terms of great single performances versus longevity performances. Presumably, this isn't really a question about what makes a great life, then, because there's so much more than that to a great life. I don't know. I'm going to push back on that. So I think the parallels are very much closer than you're making them seem. I think it's compared to Stalin. Stalin is an example of somebody who held power, considered by me to be one of the most powerful men ever. He held power for 30 years. So that's what I'm referring to longevity. And then there's a few people, I have to wish my knowledge of history was better, but people who fought a few great battles and they did not maintain power. But this contrast, say, for example, Alexander the Great, who died at 33 from probably unnatural causes, had around four to five truly defining battles in his life, which responsible for the lion's share of his achievements and burned very bright, but didn't burn long. Stalin on the other hand started from nothing, quietly, methodically worked his way through the revolutionary phase and gained increasing amounts of power. And as he said, went all the way to the end of his career. Yeah, there's definitely something you'd be said for longevity. But as to which one is greater than the other, you can't give a definition or a set of criteria which will definitively say this is better than that. But when you look, ultimately we look at Alexander as great, but in a different way and we look at Stalin, I didn't think many people would say, Stalin was a great person, but from the Machiave Island point of view, he would say he was great also. But when you think about beautiful creations done by human beings in the space of, say, martial arts in the space of sport, what inspires you? The peak of performance? I see you coming from, it's a great question. For me, it always comes down to degree of difficulty, but things are difficult in different ways. Okay? A single, flawless performance in youth is still that wins a gold mill. Say, for example, Nadia Komenech, you won the Olympic gold medal in gymnastics. The first person able to get a perfect score. If she had disappeared after that, we would still remember that as an incredible moment and the degree of difficulty to get a perfect score in Olympic gymnastics is just off the charts. And contrast that with someone who went to four Olympics and got four silver medals. I mean, they're both incredible achievements. They're just different. The attributes that lead to longevity typically tend to conflict with the attributes that bring a powerful single performance. One is all about focus on a particular event. The other is on spreading your resources over time. Both the percent tremendous difficulties. There's no need to say one is better than the other. There's also just, for me, personally, the stories of somebody who truly struggled are"

"Topic Header 14: The path to greatness

John Danaher delves into the notion of greatness, navigating through historical figures and athletic achievements to dissect the essence of a “great life”. He posits that greatness is a matter of perspective, exemplified by contrasting views on Stalin's life. From Machiavelli's standpoint, Stalin's rise from obscurity to a significant historical figure who overcame adversaries and impacted world history is seen as a testament to greatness. However, Danaher notes, "If you ask a Ukrainian farmer in the 1930s whether he lived a great life, you get a very different answer," illustrating the subjective nature of greatness.

Danaher refutes the dichotomy between achieving a singular monumental success and sustaining excellence over time. He contrasts Stalin's 30-year reign with Alexander the Great's short-lived but impactful life, marked by "four to five truly defining battles," to argue that greatness can manifest in varied forms. Danaher argues that there is no clear superiority between longevity and peak performance, stating, "There's no need to say one is better than the other."

Further exploring the theme of greatness in human creativity and achievement, Danaher brings up the example of Nadia Comaneci, the first gymnast to score a perfect 10 in an Olympic event, to highlight the pinnacle of achievement in a single moment versus the consistent excellence of an athlete who secures four silver medals across four Olympics. For Danaher, the remarkable efforts required for both feats exemplify greatness, resisting the impulse to rank one form of achievement above the other. He underscores that the narratives of struggle resonate deeply on a personal level, thus broadening the conversation about what constitutes a truly great life beyond mere achievements to include the profound challenges and adversities faced."
