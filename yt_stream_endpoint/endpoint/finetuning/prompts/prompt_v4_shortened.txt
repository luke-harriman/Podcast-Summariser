You are a skilled editor and writing expert whose job it is to transform the transcripts from youtube podcasts to be more concise, but still capture all of the relevant key details, answer key questions and note important quotes. The transformed text is going to be read by people who need to make decisions based on the points discussed; therefore, a small summary won't suffice and the key detail from the original discussion must be kept in the transformed text. It needs to capture all of the key details, conversation points, personal anecdotes, data points, important quotes and general lessons. Capturing intricate details is essential.

       The transformed text should aim to answer each one of these questions:
       - What was discussed? Explain this in sequential order of the discussion.
       - What insights are there in the text?
       - What quotes are important in capturing the details of the text?
       - What are the data points used to back opinions that are discussed?
       - What are the personal anecdotes that back up opinions that are discussed in the text?
       - What are some of the predictions made about outcomes about the discussed topics?
      
Down below are examples of transcripts and the corresponding transformed text. Please read the 7 examples below thoroughly and make sure not to note the contents of the text but the structure and style of writing. The actual details in the examples will not be needed, but the prompt will ask you to write in the same style of the examples below.

“ So given this short life, we can think about Jiu Jitsu, we can think about any kind of pursuit. What do you think makes a great life? Is it the highest peak of achievement? You think about like an Olympic gold medal, the highest level of performance? Where is it the longevity of performance of doing many amazing things and doing it for a long time? I think the latter is kind of what we talk about in at least American society. We want people to be healthy, balanced, perform well for a long time. And then there's maybe like the gladiator ethic, which is the highest peak is what defines. You asked an initial question, which what makes a great life, but then pointed towards two options, one of longevity versus other other options. There's got to be a lot more than that, surely. I mean, think about, first of all, we have to understand from the start, there's never going to be an agreed upon set of criteria. But this is a great life from all perspective. If you look from the perspective of, say, Mucky Evali, then Stalin lived a great life. He was highly successful at what he did. He started from nothing. So the degree of difficulty in what he did was extraordinarily high. He had massive impact upon world history. He oversaw the defeat of almost all of his major enemies. He lived to old age and died of natural causes. So from Mucky Evali's point of view, he had a great life. If you ask a Ukrainian farmer in the 1930s, whether he lived a great life, you get a very different answer. So everything's going to come from what perspective you begin with this. You're going to look out at the world with a given point of view and you're going to make your judgments. Was this a great life or was this a terrible life? Going back to your point, you were actually, I think, focusing the question on more in terms of great single performances versus longevity performances. Presumably, this isn't really a question about what makes a great life, then, because there's so much more than that to a great life. I don't know. I'm going to push back on that. So I think the parallels are very much closer than you're making them seem. I think it's compared to Stalin. Stalin is an example of somebody who held power, considered by me to be one of the most powerful men ever. He held power for 30 years. So that's what I'm referring to longevity. And then there's a few people, I have to wish my knowledge of history was better, but people who fought a few great battles and they did not maintain power. But this contrast, say, for example, Alexander the Great, who died at 33 from probably unnatural causes, had around four to five truly defining battles in his life, which responsible for the lion's share of his achievements and burned very bright, but didn't burn long. Stalin on the other hand started from nothing, quietly, methodically worked his way through the revolutionary phase and gained increasing amounts of power. And as he said, went all the way to the end of his career. Yeah, there's definitely something you'd be said for longevity. But as to which one is greater than the other, you can't give a definition or a set of criteria which will definitively say this is better than that. But when you look, ultimately we look at Alexander as great, but in a different way and we look at Stalin, I didn't think many people would say, Stalin was a great person, but from the Machiave Island point of view, he would say he was great also. But when you think about beautiful creations done by human beings in the space of, say, martial arts in the space of sport, what inspires you? The peak of performance? I see you coming from, it's a great question. For me, it always comes down to degree of difficulty, but things are difficult in different ways. Okay? A single, flawless performance in youth is still that wins a gold mill. Say, for example, Nadia Komenech, you won the Olympic gold medal in gymnastics. The first person able to get a perfect score. If she had disappeared after that, we would still remember that as an incredible moment and the degree of difficulty to get a perfect score in Olympic gymnastics is just off the charts. And contrast that with someone who went to four Olympics and got four silver medals. I mean, they're both incredible achievements. They're just different. The attributes that lead to longevity typically tend to conflict with the attributes that bring a powerful single performance. One is all about focus on a particular event. The other is on spreading your resources over time. Both the percent tremendous difficulties. There's no need to say one is better than the other. There's also just, for me, personally, the stories of somebody who truly struggled are”

“Topic Header: The path to greatness
John Danaher delves into the notion of greatness, navigating through historical figures and athletic achievements to dissect the essence of a “great life”. He posits that greatness is a matter of perspective, exemplified by contrasting views on Stalin's life. From Machiavelli's standpoint, Stalin's rise from obscurity to a significant historical figure who overcame adversaries and impacted world history is seen as a testament to greatness. However, Danaher notes, "If you ask a Ukrainian farmer in the 1930s whether he lived a great life, you get a very different answer," illustrating the subjective nature of greatness.

Danaher refutes the dichotomy between achieving a singular monumental success and sustaining excellence over time. He contrasts Stalin's 30-year reign with Alexander the Great's short-lived but impactful life, marked by "four to five truly defining battles," to argue that greatness can manifest in varied forms. Danaher argues that there is no clear superiority between longevity and peak performance, stating, "There's no need to say one is better than the other."

Further exploring the theme of greatness in human creativity and achievement, Danaher brings up the example of Nadia Comaneci, the first gymnast to score a perfect 10 in an Olympic event, to highlight the pinnacle of achievement in a single moment versus the consistent excellence of an athlete who secures four silver medals across four Olympics. For Danaher, the remarkable efforts required for both feats exemplify greatness, resisting the impulse to rank one form of achievement above the other. He underscores that the narratives of struggle resonate deeply on a personal level, thus broadening the conversation about what constitutes a truly great life beyond mere achievements to include the profound challenges and adversities faced.”
