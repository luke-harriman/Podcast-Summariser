The transformed text is going to be read by people who need to make decisions based on the points discussed; therefore, a small summary won't suffice and the key detail from the original discussion must be kept in the transformed text. It needs to capture all of the key details, conversation points, personal anecdotes, data points, important quotes and general lessons. Capturing intricate details is essential.

       The transformed text should aim to answer each one of these questions:
       - What was discussed? Explain this in sequential order of the discussion.
       - What insights are there in the text?
       - What quotes are important in capturing the details of the text?
       - What are the data points used to back opinions that are discussed?
       - What are the personal anecdotes that back up opinions that are discussed in the text?
       - What are some of the predictions made about outcomes about the discussed topics?
      
Down below are examples of transcripts and the corresponding transformed text. Please read the 7 examples below thoroughly and make sure not to note the contents of the text but the structure and style of writing. The actual details in the examples will not be needed, but the prompt will ask you to write in the same style of the examples below.

“ Yeah. Let's I mean, we double click on a couple items there. We'll see. All right. Let's I want to go over one more thing where we're cooking with oil here and I just wanted to talk a little bit about the P.O.s possibly coming back. I just interviewed Alexis Ohanian, the founder of Reddit, which according to Bloomberg, they've been advised by potential IPO investors to target a $5 billion valuation. They're going to go public possibly in March, which is wild. That's only a couple of weeks away. In peak, Zer, Reddit had raised at a $10 billion valuation. That was back in 2021. They were valued in 15 billion in the secondary market. That's where people like previous employees, angel investors, etc. might trade their shares. And so if it goes out of five, it's going to be between a 50% to their tear cut. And it is trading at 4.5 billion. Shama, we talked about this a bunch, the down run IPO's Instagram. I think being the best example, they got out, but they've been hovering at a really low number for a long time and people have been talking about them possibly being a takeout candidate by DoorDash or Amazon or Uber. So your thoughts on the Reddit IPO, is I think that if I had to price the IPO, I would be modeling to important levers in the business. The first is what is the actual attainable revenue from my audience? And so what is the arpooh of the average Reddit user? And you can model it as a distribution. And I think Facebook has the best data because they've been publishing it in their quarterly returns for a very long time now for over a decade, which is there is a distribution of value of a Facebook user economically. At the upper end, you have the folks that are on Facebook proper in America, in a certain age band, in certain states that are probably like 30, 40, 50 dollar arpoohs all the way down to developing countries, those users are worth low single digit dollars economically. And I think that people will have to very much understand what is the average Reddit user and what is the distribution of economic value that they represent. That's the first thing. And I think that that's really the thing that will determine whether it's worth 5 billion or 10 billion or frankly 2 billion. And then the second key lever, it will be the risk factors in the IPO because where the shareholder lawsuits will come from, which will really dictate if the how the hedge fund community buys this thing is going to be the potential for my ad ran against content that is deeply offensive to me. That whole construct. And I think that they are going to have to very carefully ring fence that liability to get this IPO to be successful, but also for them to execute a scaled ad revenue business. And not spending enough time on Reddit, I don't know how bad of a problem this is. I don't think it's 4,000 or 8,000 as an example. But I also don't think it's Facebook and Instagram. And so it's kind of somewhere in the middle. And I think that those risks are really what's going to determine its terminal valuation. You're now that they they have always been under monetized 800 million dollars in revenue reportedly and 400 million monthly active users. So two bucks a user compared to get 20 30 40 for the prime users in yeah on Facebook's network. So it's totally underutilized. Part of it is it's a little bit of spicy content. Part of it is that's the number including all the international users. Of course, there is this concept that Reddit has the greatest pool of data for large language models. And you know, with something like say, Quora, YouTube, amongst the great pools of data. So you think there's a play here with that. They have talked about they want to get paid for licensing and that if you want to use their data for your language money, you got to get permission to your thoughts. Sure. I mean, that's going to be an incremental revenue source for sure. It's hard to know exactly how valuable that is because we're still in the early innings. But I mean, they can definitely do something with that data. Grox whole competitive advantage is having exclusive access to Twitter's data, which is updated in real time basically by hundreds of millions of users. So yeah, look, that data is valuable. We don't know how much. I guess the numbers I saw were that they're doing about 800 million of revenue growing about 20% a year. The $5 billion valuation seems I think pretty good. I mean, is it down from 10 at the peak in 2021? Sure. But everything is down since that peak. I mean, that was definitely a bubble. I mean, I can tell you, we bought some shares as a late stage investment, I think in 2018 at a $2 billion valuation. So, you know, a two and a half X in five years. I mean, it's not saying the world on fire, but it's not a bad outcome. Yeah. And you know, the investment bankers will know how to price this to take it out and make it successful. Yeah. And if it had a, if it was a, if it becomes a billion dollars in revenue and have a 20% profit margin, 200 million, you can, you can start to a year back of the envelope math there for 25 EBITDA, you know, 20 times price earnings ratio. So it doesn't seem outrageous. It does seem like such valuable and under monetized asset. Do you think there's a likely a choir here if you were to think about somebody who might want to own this? Do you think it's a Microsoft for the data, Google for the data? Yeah. I think there's probably people who would like to own this, but the problem is that, well, two problems. One is they just can't get it through. We've talked about this before. The M&A window is even more closed than the IPO window, I would say. And the other thing is just because of the raunchy content and all of the brand issues that come with that. It's not clear to me that, let's say a Microsoft would want to own that headache. You know, they might not want to be hauled up in front of these congressional hearings that we talked about. These kangaroo courts where it's very easy to go on Reddit and pick out, well, what about this post? What about that post? Why'd you let that go? Why'd you let that go? Why'd you let that go? Well, because it's a platform of user generated content where hundreds of millions of people post what billions of items. And you can have the best content moderation policy in the world. There's always going to be edge cases I get through. I think that Reddit is the honey pot of edge cases. It is the place you go when you're just so disaffected that you can just let loose anonymously. It's not right. I mean, at a certain point, you have to realize that when people cherry pick those edge cases, what they're really saying is a platform like this shouldn't exist. Right? Because there's no way to eliminate every single one. Which is basically like saying, if you just take platform, you say conversation, you're saying this conversation shouldn't be allowed to exist. They don't want user generated content to exist. They don't want on what remember within your time is called unfettered conversations. Unfettered conversations. They want controlled conversations. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty dangerous. It just reminds me of remember Bob Eiger for like 10 seconds was actually considering Disney buying Twitter. Can you imagine if they actually bought it? What would have happened? I mean, it would have been chaos. Well, it would have been content moderation on steroids where they would have massively empowered and scaled up content moderation even more than what Jack Dorsey's Twitter was doing. Because I think Jack actually, he was unable to operationalize his principles, but he did have principles in favor of free speech. Absolutely. Whereas Disney, I don't even think has those principles. So they would have censored everything. Yeah. You know, it's paradoxically the most censored social media platform is TikTok. My TikTok is bulldogs and sandwiches like you, Chimoff, and then sopranos clips. And every time there's a sopranos clips when somebody gets whacked, they have to blur it out or the person who's uploading it takes that clip and cuts out the actual person being whacked. It's crazy. All right. I got to give Saks his red meat. We're going to now go to our war course. David Sacks,”

“Reddit's potential IPO, advised by investors to target a $5 billion valuation, marks a significant moment for the company, which was valued at $10 billion in 2021 and $15 billion in the secondary market. This potential 50% to 67% valuation cut reflects broader market conditions and investor sentiment. The discussion highlights key considerations for Reddit's IPO pricing, including the average revenue per user (ARPU) and the platform's unique position regarding user-generated content and potential legal liabilities.

Reddit's average revenue per user (ARPU), a critical metric for assessing its valuation, contrasts with Facebook's well-documented ARPU distribution, ranging from $30-50 in developed markets to single digits in developing regions. Reddit's challenge lies in accurately identifying its user base's value, considering its global and diverse audience. Furthermore, legal risks associated with content moderation and advertiser backlash against controversial content are pivotal. Successfully mitigating these risks is essential for Reddit's IPO success and long-term ad revenue scalability.

Despite these challenges, Reddit remains an under-monetized platform, with reported revenues of $800 million from 400 million monthly active users, indicating a $2 ARPU. This is significantly lower than Facebook's ARPU, highlighting untapped revenue potential. The platform's vast data pool, particularly valuable for developing large language models, represents an incremental revenue opportunity. However, monetizing this asset depends on the evolving digital economy's dynamics and Reddit's strategic decisions.”

“ So given this short life, we can think about Jiu Jitsu, we can think about any kind of pursuit. What do you think makes a great life? Is it the highest peak of achievement? You think about like an Olympic gold medal, the highest level of performance? Where is it the longevity of performance of doing many amazing things and doing it for a long time? I think the latter is kind of what we talk about in at least American society. We want people to be healthy, balanced, perform well for a long time. And then there's maybe like the gladiator ethic, which is the highest peak is what defines. You asked an initial question, which what makes a great life, but then pointed towards two options, one of longevity versus other other options. There's got to be a lot more than that, surely. I mean, think about, first of all, we have to understand from the start, there's never going to be an agreed upon set of criteria. But this is a great life from all perspective. If you look from the perspective of, say, Mucky Evali, then Stalin lived a great life. He was highly successful at what he did. He started from nothing. So the degree of difficulty in what he did was extraordinarily high. He had massive impact upon world history. He oversaw the defeat of almost all of his major enemies. He lived to old age and died of natural causes. So from Mucky Evali's point of view, he had a great life. If you ask a Ukrainian farmer in the 1930s, whether he lived a great life, you get a very different answer. So everything's going to come from what perspective you begin with this. You're going to look out at the world with a given point of view and you're going to make your judgments. Was this a great life or was this a terrible life? Going back to your point, you were actually, I think, focusing the question on more in terms of great single performances versus longevity performances. Presumably, this isn't really a question about what makes a great life, then, because there's so much more than that to a great life. I don't know. I'm going to push back on that. So I think the parallels are very much closer than you're making them seem. I think it's compared to Stalin. Stalin is an example of somebody who held power, considered by me to be one of the most powerful men ever. He held power for 30 years. So that's what I'm referring to longevity. And then there's a few people, I have to wish my knowledge of history was better, but people who fought a few great battles and they did not maintain power. But this contrast, say, for example, Alexander the Great, who died at 33 from probably unnatural causes, had around four to five truly defining battles in his life, which responsible for the lion's share of his achievements and burned very bright, but didn't burn long. Stalin on the other hand started from nothing, quietly, methodically worked his way through the revolutionary phase and gained increasing amounts of power. And as he said, went all the way to the end of his career. Yeah, there's definitely something you'd be said for longevity. But as to which one is greater than the other, you can't give a definition or a set of criteria which will definitively say this is better than that. But when you look, ultimately we look at Alexander as great, but in a different way and we look at Stalin, I didn't think many people would say, Stalin was a great person, but from the Machiave Island point of view, he would say he was great also. But when you think about beautiful creations done by human beings in the space of, say, martial arts in the space of sport, what inspires you? The peak of performance? I see you coming from, it's a great question. For me, it always comes down to degree of difficulty, but things are difficult in different ways. Okay? A single, flawless performance in youth is still that wins a gold mill. Say, for example, Nadia Komenech, you won the Olympic gold medal in gymnastics. The first person able to get a perfect score. If she had disappeared after that, we would still remember that as an incredible moment and the degree of difficulty to get a perfect score in Olympic gymnastics is just off the charts. And contrast that with someone who went to four Olympics and got four silver medals. I mean, they're both incredible achievements. They're just different. The attributes that lead to longevity typically tend to conflict with the attributes that bring a powerful single performance. One is all about focus on a particular event. The other is on spreading your resources over time. Both the percent tremendous difficulties. There's no need to say one is better than the other. There's also just, for me, personally, the stories of somebody who truly struggled are” 

Response 2:
“John Danaher delves into the notion of greatness, navigating through historical figures and athletic achievements to dissect the essence of a “great life”. He posits that greatness is a matter of perspective, exemplified by contrasting views on Stalin's life. From Machiavelli's standpoint, Stalin's rise from obscurity to a significant historical figure who overcame adversaries and impacted world history is seen as a testament to greatness. However, Danaher notes, "If you ask a Ukrainian farmer in the 1930s whether he lived a great life, you get a very different answer," illustrating the subjective nature of greatness.

Danaher refutes the dichotomy between achieving a singular monumental success and sustaining excellence over time. He contrasts Stalin's 30-year reign with Alexander the Great's short-lived but impactful life, marked by "four to five truly defining battles," to argue that greatness can manifest in varied forms. Danaher argues that there is no clear superiority between longevity and peak performance, stating, "There's no need to say one is better than the other."

Further exploring the theme of greatness in human creativity and achievement, Danaher brings up the example of Nadia Comaneci, the first gymnast to score a perfect 10 in an Olympic event, to highlight the pinnacle of achievement in a single moment versus the consistent excellence of an athlete who secures four silver medals across four Olympics. For Danaher, the remarkable efforts required for both feats exemplify greatness, resisting the impulse to rank one form of achievement above the other. He underscores that the narratives of struggle resonate deeply on a personal level, thus broadening the conversation about what constitutes a truly great life beyond mere achievements to include the profound challenges and adversities faced.”

“ most people don't seem to believe in that but is drilling. I don't know. Maybe people are different but I love the idea, maybe even outside of the digits of doing the same thing over and over. It's like zero dreams of sushi. I love doing the thing that nobody wants to do and doing it 10 times, 100 times, 1000 times more than what nobody wants to do. So I'm a huge fan of drilling. Obviously I'm not a professional athlete but I feel like if I actually gave myself, if I wanted to be really good at jiu jitsu, like reach the level of being in the top 25 when I was much younger, like really strive, I think I could achieve it by drilling. That's, I had this belief untested. Can you challenge this idea? Or agree with that? Of fascinating. However, we're going to have to disagree. No, no, no. We're just going to have to start to understand what are we talking about when we talk about drilling. It's a very vague term. Okay. If you're at this moment, many of your listeners are probably having the same thought process which is that oh drilling, yeah, I know what that is. We go into the gym and we pick a move and we practice it for a certain number of repetitions. And if I do that, I'm going to get better at the technique. Okay. They're wrong. We've got to have a much more in depth understanding of what the hell we're talking about when we talk about drilling. Ultimately, any movement in the gym that doesn't improve the skills you already have or build new skills is a waste of time, a waste of resources. Everything you do should be done with the aim and the understanding that this is going to make me better at the sport I practice. If it's not, shouldn't be there. The majority of what passes for drilling in most training halls will not make you better, including some of the most cherished forms of drilling, which is repetition for numbers. The moment you say to someone, I want you to do this a hundred times. What are they really thinking about? Volume. They're saying, okay, I'm at repetition 78. I'm at 80, 20 more to go. Their primary thought process is on numbers. That's not the point of drilling. The point is skill acquisition. When people drill, don't get them focused on numbers, get them focused on mechanics. That's what they have to worry about. I never have my students drill for numbers ever. This won't prove through. Get the fuck out of here. Are you kidding me? I know you're going to get better with that. Okay, get them working on the sense of gaining knowledge. That's my job. I have to give them knowledge. I have to explain to them what they're trying to do. That starts them on the right track. But knowledge is one thing. Skill is another. If Giujitsu was just about knowledge, then all the 60 and 70-year-old Red Balls would be the world champion. They're not. Giujitsu isn't won by knowledge. It's won by skill. Knowledge is the first step in building skill. My job as a coach is to transmit knowledge. Then I have to create training programs where the path from knowledge to polished skill is carried out. That's the interface between me and my students. I give them drills where the whole emphasis is upon getting a sense where they understand what are the problems they're trying to solve and working towards practical solutions. They never work with numbers. They work with mechanics and feel. Then you have to bring in the idea of progression. When you drill, there's zero resistance. When you fight in competition, there's 100% resistance. You can't go from zero to 100. There has to be progress over time where I have them work and drills with slightly increasing increments of resistance. Just as we talked about earlier with the weightlifter who doesn't start with 500 pounds but who begins with the bar and then over time builds the skills that one day out there in the future, he will live 500 pounds. So too, that Judy Gatami that you're working on today is feeble and pathetic. That five years from now, you'll win a world championship with it. You can't have this naive idea of drilling as something you just come out. You randomly pick a move and you work for numbers until you satisfy the certain set of numbers that you coach throughout you and then think you're going to get better. There's even dangers with drilling. There is no performance increase that comes once you get to a certain level and you just keep doing the same damn thing. Let's say for example, you come out and you hit 100 repetitions of the arm by Judy Gatami from God position and you're all proud of yourself because you hit 100 repetitions and your body's tired and you're telling yourself, man, I got a good workout and you come in tomorrow and you do exactly the same thing. You come in the day after that and a week goes by and you're done the same thing. Then a year later, you do the same thing. Ask yourself, has your Judy Gatami really gotten better? No. It performed literally thousands and thousands of repetitions. You have spent an enormous amount of training time and energy that could have gone in different directions on something which didn't make you any better. Drills have diminishing returns. Once you get to a certain skill level, if you just keep hammering on the same thing in the same fashion for the same amount of time, you stop getting better. Can I partially, for fun, partially for Delazavik, but partially because I actually believe this to push back on some points, is it possible? So everything you said I think is beautiful and correct. But the asking yourself the question, am I getting better? Is it really important? You could do that in training. Is there a set of techniques, maybe a small subset of all the techniques that are in Jiu-Jitsu, where you can have significant skill acquisition if you put in the numbers or the time, whatever, on a technique against an opponent who's not resisting? Here's, let me elaborate. What I, it might, maybe I'm different. You'll probably have to finish an example. Yes. Let me first make a general statement that I can give examples. The general statement is, I found that through repetitions, and this is high repetitions, combined with training, but high repetitions against a non-resisting opponent, I've gotten to understand the way my body moves, the way I apply pressure on a human. Because it's not actually zero resistance. The opponent's still laying there. They're still keeping their legs up. They're still doing, they might not be resisting, but they're still creating. They're creating a structure. They're presenting a target. Yes. It's not dynamic, so you can't master the timing of things, but you can master the, not master, but I felt like I could gain an understanding of how to apply pressure to the human body over thousands of repetitions. For example, I just, just to give you an example to know what we're talking about. There's a guy named Salo Hibero and Sean G. Hibero that have this, I guess, I already forgot, but the headquarters position or something like that. But putting pressure as you pass guard, like medium passing distance kind of pressure, I've did thousands of repetitions of that to understand what putting pressure with my hips feels like. To truly understand that movement, I felt like I was getting much better. It's like it's hard to put into words, but that skill acquisition is so subtle, just the way you turn your hips, but you're already talking about a better form of drilling now. You're going beyond the basic numbers and you're getting the sense of feeling mechanics, which is what we want in drilling. But the reason I say numbers, and maybe you could speak to this, but this might be no CD thing, but it allows you to take a journey that doesn't just last a week or two weeks, but a journey where you stay with the technique for two, three years. And there's a dedication to it where it's a long term commitment to where you're forcing yourself, perhaps there's other mechanisms, but you're forcing yourself to stay with the technique longer than most people around you are staying with whatever they're working on. And you're taking that long journey and the numbers somehow enforce that persistence and that dedication. This thing that journeys a wonderful thing, and if that technique is a crucial part of what you do, then it's time well-invested, but I always understand that it comes at an opportunity cost that by spending that amount of time on that one technique, you've sacrificed other things that you could have learned that could have won you matches. So understand that every focus upon one element of the game comes at the opportunity cost of other elements. Now as long as you're playing a part of the game where, okay, this is central to what I do, okay, that's fine, but just be aware of the danger of opportunity cost. That's something no one talks about on the training room, but it becomes very important. Secondly, the other question you have to start asking yourself is, okay, that training clearly had benefits for you early on. But when the point of diminishing returns starts coming in, if you feel you're just doing the same thing, then it's time to switch. Now if you feel you're still getting benefit from it, by all means, continue. That will be a call on your part. You've been playing this game a long time now, so I would trust your call on that. But my job is a coach, just to look out and say, okay, this kid's been working cross-sashigerami for six months. And I feel he's gotten to a good skill level. If he stays any further on it, the opportunity cost becomes greater than the expected benefits of continuing it. And that's my job as a coach, just to direct things in that fashion. If I can do a good job with that, then I can take them to the next level of drilling and start amping it up. And that's how I keep progress over time. My biggest fear is to have students run past the point of diminishing returns, staying stagnant, where opportunity costs comes in and they're not making the progress they could in the time that they've been working. I mean, it was almost a philosophical question for me. That's what I was always on a search on because I know my mind is like drilling. I don't like relying on other people for improvement. And drilling allows me to do something that is kind of persistent. It's interesting, Lex, but you say you don't like relying on other people for drilling, but in drilling, you really do rely a lot on your partner. One of the first things I do when I coach people is I teach them how to drill. That's a skill in itself. And drilling is, in a sense, the opposite of sparring. drilling is a cooperative venture where you work as dance partners, complimenting each other's movement. If I drill with Gordon Ryan and I want him to work on bars, I will move my body in ways which make it an interesting exercise for Gordon. I'm not just sitting there and he does a repetition and I'm okay, he does 10. I can't wait for this to be over so I can do my 10 and I can't wait for all this to be over so I can just sparring and get over with all this bullshit. That's the sad truth of most drilling and juuderser. There's a sense in which when good people drill, it's like watching good people dance. They move in unison and compliment each other's movement and make each other look better. Sparring on the other hand is the exact opposite of that. That's resistance where you're trying to make that person look as bad as possible. And once you understand the different directions in which drilling and sparring go, that's when things start getting interesting. You start getting fast progress. Yeah, just absolutely right. I think I was not very eloquent describing what I mean. I found myself not able to find any jiu jitsu to many people that are willing to dedicate a huge amount of time to a particular technique. I can crew with you on that. Now, answer the interesting question. Why? Why can't you get people to drill with you? By the way, if I could just shout out the people that did drill with me is usually blue belt women because they're smaller. They don't like training because they get their ass kicked because they're much smaller. So they're willing to improve. Invest a significant amount of effort into training. That's good. But their motivation for doing so is not good. Well, yes, but your motivation for drilling is because you don't want to get your ass kicked. No, a good motivation. A black belt. Ever. I could never find a black belt that I could drill with like this. Now let's go back to that question. Why? I don't. I mean, I am somebody who likes to say nice things about people. So let me answer the question. Let me answer for you. Yeah. Two reasons because they find a boring. Yes. And secondly, they have more importantly, they don't believe it works. Yeah. Those are good answers. And now let's go further and ask the truly interesting question. Why do they believe that? If I were to answer it, in the context of Russian wrestling, we're drilling as much bigger part as I think culturally, that was knowledge that everybody tells each other. Injiujitsu that drilling doesn't work because they never taught how to drill. Now one of us sits you down one day and says, OK, this is how you drill. And so the exercise feels futile. They don't feel the skill level is going up. They don't associate drilling with increased skill level. They associate sparring with increased skill level, but not drilling, which is a tragedy because it is a fantastic way to introduce and expand the repertoire of a developing student. It's an essential part of every workout I teach. I always say that game of jiujitsu begins with knowledge and builds up to skill who wins is the one who has greater skill and nine times out of ten. So to me, it's a tragedy that what you're saying breaks my heart. You couldn't get a black belt to drill with you. That's shameful. But I understand I sympathize with those black belts too because the way in which most people are told to drill does feel ineffective and it is damn boring. They'd rather just spar. They feel like they get more out of the workout. And that's if anything, an indictment upon most of the training programs around the nation. We just say that drilling, if you were to build a black belt world champion, or drilling be what percent of their training will be in the entirety of their career would be drilling. Good. Great question. Let's first put a provider on it that I don't do the same thing for all athletes. Everyone's got a different personality. And like Nikki Rodd, I can only hold his attention for two minutes at a time. And Gary Tonan, five minutes, Gordon Ryan, five hours, like George St. Pierre, five hours, Trevor Stevens, five hours. They are just laser focused. So everyone's different. Let's put that down as our first provider. You probably knew those answers already. That's hilarious. But as a general rule, if I run a two and a half hour class, you can expect an hour and a half of it to be, I'm going to use the word drilling, but I'm also going to say that this is too complex of a story to give now with words. I would need to demonstrate it. But the way in which we drill is not just standard method of drilling. And then it's into sparring. And if you give me a choice between a bad drilling partner and sparring, I could make the same choice that most black belts make, which I would go with sparring. Because you can create drilling with it with an exodendus sparring environment. Like, good drilling is a wonderful thing. Bad drilling is a still worthless waste of time. Okay. Before I have a million questions for you, but I have to ask, can you, we've described the fundamentals as Jitsu.”

“John Danaher delved into the essence of mastering drilling in Jiu Jitsu. Danaher dismantled the conventional drill practice of mindlessly repeating a movement for a numerical goal, critiquing it as a flawed focus on quantity over the essential—quality. He passionately argued, "I'm at repetition 78. I'm at 80, 20 more to go... that's not the point of drilling. The point is skill acquisition... don't get them focused on numbers, get them focused on mechanics…everything you do should be done with the aim and the understanding that this is going to make me better," highlighting the pursuit of skill acquisition through a deep understanding of mechanics rather than mere volume.

Danaher's innovative drilling methodology prioritizes mechanical accuracy and the tactile 'feel' of each movement, advocating for a gradual increase in resistance to simulate real competitive scenarios. He illustrated this concept by comparing drilling to weightlifting, where a lifter starts with lighter weights and gradually increases the load. Similarly, a technique like Judy Gatami, initially weak, can be developed into a championship-winning move over time with the right approach to drilling. Danaher notes, “Just as we talked about earlier with the weightlifter who doesn't start with 500 pounds…start with the bar and one day he will lift 500 pounds. So too, that Judy Gatami that you're working on today is feeble and pathetic. That five years from now, you'll win a world championship with it.”

The conversation also shed light on the cultural and educational gaps in martial arts training, particularly the challenge of finding committed drilling partners. Danaher argued that the reluctance towards drilling stems from its repetitiveness and questioned effectiveness, a sentiment rooted in a lack of proper drilling education. He encapsulated the necessity of evolving from knowledge to skill with the remark, "If Jiu Jitsu was just about knowledge, then all the 60 and 70-year-old Red Belts would be world champions."

Danaher's approach is person-centered, recognizing varied attention spans and learning styles among athletes, such as Nikki Rodd and Gordon Ryan, and adapting drilling intensity accordingly. He posits that intelligent, purpose-driven drilling forms a significant portion of training for athletes aspiring to reach the pinnacle of their martial arts career. ”

“ Yeah. So like I said, somehow controversially you've been a proponent of peace on Twitter, on X. Yeah. So let me ask you about the wars going on today and to see what the path to peace could be. How do you hope the current war in Israel and Gaza comes to an end? What path do you see that can minimize human suffering in the long term in that part of the world? Well, I think that probably the world is... Definitely, if you look up the... There is no easy answer in dictionary. It'll be that picture of the Middle East in Israel especially. So there is no easy answer. Or what my... This is strictly my opinion of... Is that the goal of Moss was to provoke an overreaction from Israel. They obviously do not expect to have a military victory, but they really wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel. And then leverage that aggressive response to rally Muslims worldwide for the cause of Gaza and Palestine, which they have succeeded in doing. So the counter-intuitive thing here, I think that the thing that I think should be done, even though it's very difficult, is that... I would recommend that Israel engage in the most conspicuous acts of kindness possible, every part, everything. That is the actual thing that would thwart the goal of Moss. So in some sense, does it agree that makes sense in geopolitics turning the other cheek implemented? It's not exactly turning the other cheek, because I do think that there's... I think it is appropriate for Israel to find the Moss members, and either kill them or accostrate them. That's something that has to be done, because they're just going to keep coming otherwise. But in addition to that, they need to do whatever they can. There's some talk of establishing, for example, a mobile hospital. I'd recommend doing that. Just making sure that this food, water, medical necessities, and just be over the top about it, and be very transparent. So people can't claim it's a trick. Just put a way of camera on the thing. 24-7. Deploy acts of kindness. Yes, conspicuous acts of kindness. That are unequivocal. I mean, they can't be somehow... Because the Moss will then... their response will be always a trick. Therefore, you have to counter how it is not a trick. This ultimately fights the broader force of hatred in the region. Yes. I'm not sure who said it to some of our Procurement saying, but an eye for an eye makes everyone blind. Now, that neck of the woods, they really believe in the whole eye for an eye thing. But if you're not going to just outright commit genocide against an entire people, which I would not be acceptable to be acceptable to anyone, then you're going to leave a lot of people alive who subsequently hate Israel. Really, the question is, for every Hamas member that you kill, how many did you create? And if you create more than you kill, you've not succeeded. That's the real situation there. And it's safe to say that if... If you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you've made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill Israeli. That's the situation. But this is one of the most contentious subjects one could possibly discuss. I think if the goal is long term peace, one has to be looked at this from standpoint of over time, are there more or fewer terrorists being created? Let me just link on war. Yeah. War would say, war existed and always will exist. Always will exist. Always has existed and always will exist. I hope not. You think it always will. This question of how much will and what... There's the scope and scale of war. But to my attention that there would not be any more in the future, I think would be very unlikely outcome. You talked about the culture series. There's war even there. Yes. The giant war. The first book starts off with a gigantic galactic war where trillions die. But it still nevertheless protects these pockets of flourishing. Somehow you can have galactic war and still have pockets of flourishing. Yeah. I guess if we are able to one day to expand to full the galaxy or whatever, there will be a galactic war at some point. The scale of war has been increasing and increasing. It's like a race between the scale of suffering and the scale of flourishing. Yes. A lot of people seem to be using this tragedy to beat the drums of war and feed the military industrial complex. Do you worry about this? The people who are rooting for escalation and how can it be stopped?”

“In discussing the Israel-Hamas conflict, Elon Musk offers a nuanced view on achieving peace in a region steeped in historical conflict. He suggests, "The goal of Hamas was to provoke an overreaction from Israel," aiming to unify global Muslim support through showcasing Israeli aggressions. Musk proposes an unconventional peace strategy for Israel: "engage in the most conspicuous acts of kindness possible." He elaborates on tangible measures like establishing mobile hospitals and ensuring access to essential resources such as food, water, and medical supplies. Musk emphasizes the importance of transparency in these acts, suggesting, "Just put a webcam on the thing, 24/7," to dispel any notions of deceit.

Musk candidly discusses the dynamics of retaliation and its counterproductive nature, quoting, "an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind," to criticize the cycle of violence and its failure to resolve the underlying issues. He points out the paradox of targeting Hamas members, questioning, "for every Hamas member that you kill, how many did you create?" This reflects his deeper contemplation on the counterintuitive outcomes of military actions and the necessity of a strategic shift toward kindness and humanitarian aid.

Reflecting on the broader theme of conflict, Musk acknowledges the seemingly inherent nature of war, stating, "War has always existed and always will exist." He draws from Iain M. Banks' Culture series to illustrate the inevitability and scale of war, even in futuristic galactic societies. Yet, Musk highlights the critical balance between "the scale of suffering and the scale of flourishing," underscoring the potential to sustain growth and prosperity even amidst conflict.

Musk expresses concern over the exploitation of the tragedy to "beat the drums of war and feed the military-industrial complex," urging a discernment between calls for escalation and genuine pursuits of peace. ”
